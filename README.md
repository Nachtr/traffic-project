# US Traffic Accidents

Overview:
The aim of this project was to analyze the (US ACCIDENTS DATASET) to uncover patterns or factors that influence crash severity. The assignments end goal was to provide the Department of Transportation (DOT) with actionable, and data-driven steps that could reduce severe crashes and improve overall road safety.

This project demonstrates the following:
- Data Cleaning and Prep with Pandas and NumPy
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Statistical testing and modeling with scikit-learn
- Dashboard and visualization with Tableau
- Translation of technical findings with business insights

The project structure is the following:
L data/
L DS_traf_proj.ipynb
L heatmap_summary.csv
L lighting_summary.csv
L rush_summary.csv
L weather_summary.csv
L README.md                 # You are here!

Key Findings:
- We found that weather was what mostly impacted severity: Rain and Clouds specifically
- Rush hour introduced risk
- Lighting and visibility matter
- Crashes spike during the morning and evening commute hours
